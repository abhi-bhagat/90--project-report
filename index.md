# 90% PROJECT REPORT

Our team is working on a project that is almost complete. We are just working on some final features. We have successfully integrated the database with the fusion charts. We have been successfully able to visualize the data. Now we are working on features like:
* Showing the specific medicine related to the disease that is being searched
* Showing the complete detail about that medicine when we click on the chart showing medicine information.

## THINGS THAT WENT WELL
#### 1. Database was succesfully integrated
#### 2. Data was successfully visualized

## THINGS THAT DIDN'T WENT WELL
#### 1. In user database we were not able to update the table for user when he/she signup.

## INTERESTING THINGS
Fusion charts is an really interesting application. Using that we will be able to visualize different medicines that are used in different regions. We are 60% done with it and maybe include in the project.

## NEXT WEEK TODO's
* Making the feature that show different medicine according to disease searched.
* Polish the website
* Fix bugs related to user signup
